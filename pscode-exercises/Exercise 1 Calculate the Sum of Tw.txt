// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if number ends with(0,2,4,6,8) it is even  

If number ends with (1,3,5,7,9) it is odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)
A.2/11/4/13/5
b.The addition of 2+11+4+13+5 should equal 35 then divide 35 by how many numbers were used which is 5 so 35/5 will equal 7
C.Smallest(2) largest(13)
D.to find the smallest number we will check them in chronological order which would be 2. 
to find the largest number we will look at the numbers and see which is chronologically bigger which is 13.
